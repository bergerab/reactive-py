* Reactive
The original Haskell code is in the ~./docs~ folder, and the Python code
is in ~./reactive~.

~asyncm.py~ has a few tests that can be run manually by running the code
in a REPL and calling them.

~emitter.py~ has some tests that are run from the ~testsuite()~ function,
you can just run that file to run the tests.
